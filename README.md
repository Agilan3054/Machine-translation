# Tamil to English Machine Translation

This project aims to develop a machine translation system that translates text from the Tamil language to English. The translation model is built using PyTorch and employs a sequence-to-sequence architecture with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units.

## Introduction

Machine translation is the task of automatically converting text from one language into another while preserving its meaning. In this project, we focus on translating text from Tamil, a native language of India, to English, a widely spoken global language.
